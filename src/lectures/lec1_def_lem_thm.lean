In this lesson, we learn how to define stuff in Lean. We also learn to state and use lemmas and theorems in Lean to prove some basic arithmetic equalities in combination with the tactics `refl`, `exact`, `rw`, and `change` we learned in the previous lesson.

/-! ## Definitions, Lemmas, Theorems -/


section 
/- 
We can __define__ new stuff in Lean: A __definition__ assigns an expression to a keyword and puts it in the environment.
  def keyword : type := expression
In below, we define `foo` as the natural number `5`.  
-/   

def foo : nat := 5

#check foo
#print foo
#check foo + 7

/- 
We can similarly state a __lemma__ or a __theorem__. A lemma or a theorem is written the same way as `example` except that we give name to our lemmas and theorems for further use. 

- A genral __term style__ form of a `lemma` or a `theorem` is as follows: 

lemma name_of_lemma (context_of_our_assumptions) : 
  statement_of_lemma
:= proof_of_lemma

- A general form of a `lemma` in __tactic style__: 

lemma name_of_lemma (context_of_our_assumptions) : 
  statement_we_wanna_prove := 
begin 
  tactic_1 [...], 
  tactic_2 [...], 
  ⋮ 
  tactic_n [...], 
end 

For instance, in below, we have a __term-style__ of the lemma `bar`: 
- `bar` is the __name_of_lemma__ which we can invoke later. 
- `(m n : ℤ)` is th __context__ of the lemma: these are the parameters which are used in the statement of the lemma. Think of context as a way of telling to Lean "let x, y, z, and n be natural numbers".
- `2 + n + m = n + 2 + m` is the __statement__ of the lemma: i.e. the thing we want to prove. The statement is usually a proposition which makes sense only in a given context. For instance, the contexts 
` m : ℕ `, and ` m n : ℕ ` would not work. Try! 
-/

lemma bar (m n : ℤ) : 
  2 + n - m = n + 2 - m :=   
congr_arg (λ x, x - m) (add_comm 2 n) -- you do not need to understand this proof now

#check bar 
#check (bar 2 : ∀ (n : ℤ), 2 + n - 2 = n + 2 - 2)
#check (bar 2 5 : 2 + 5 - 2 = 5 + 2 - 2)

/- In below, 
-`flt` is the __name_of_theorem__ which we can invoke later. 
- `(x y z n : ℕ)` is th __context__ of the theorem: 
- `n > 2 → x * y * z ≠ 0 → x^n + y^n ≠ z^n` is the __statement__ of the theorem:
-`sorry` is a way of telling Lean that we are going to supply a __proof__ later. 

-/
theorem flt (x y z n : ℕ) :
  n > 2 → x * y * z ≠ 0 → x^n + y^n ≠ z^n :=
sorry

theorem goldbach : ∀ n, 2 < n → n % 2 = 0 →
  ∃ p q : ℕ, p.prime ∧ q.prime ∧ n = p + q :=
sorry

/-
If we do not want to refer to the result we are proving we can simply declare it as `example`. It works the same way as theorem declaration, but without a name. 
-/
example : 
  2 + 3 = 5 := 
rfl

end --end of the section 



/-
Here we are going to a state a lemma which says that equality in a type `X` is symmetric, i.e. if `x = y` in X then `y = x`. We are going to call this lemma `symme_of_eq`, but you could as well chosen a different name.
Here's a proof of the lemma `symm_of_eq` (symmetry of equality) for any type `X` in the tactic style.  
-/

lemma symm_of_eq {X : Type} (x y : X) (h₁ : x = y) : 
  y = x := 
begin
  rw h₁, 
end 


/-
Here's a proof of the lemma `trans_of_eq` (transitivity of equality) for any type `X` in the tactic style.  
-/

lemma trans_of_eq {X : Type} (x y z : X) (h₁ : x = y) (h₂ : y = z) : 
  x = z := 
begin
  rw h₁, 
  rw h₂,    
end 


/-! ### Using definitions, lemmas, theorems -/

/-
We prove the lemma `bar` above, and we would like to use it to prove 
  `2 + n - 1 = n + 2 - 1` := 
which is a special case of `bar` when `m =1`. We do this by the expression `bar 1 n`. 
-/
example (n : ℤ) :
  2 + n - 1 = n + 2 - 1 := 
bar 1 n


#check eq.symm -- a lemma in lean library 
example (m n : ℕ) (e : m^2 = n) : 
  n = m^2 := 
begin
 exact (eq.symm e), -- here's how we use the lemma `eq.symm`. 
end


#check eq.subst
example (m n : ℕ) (h : n + 1 = 7) (e : m = n) : m + 1 = 7 := 
begin
 exact eq.subst (eq.symm e) h, 
end


#check (zero_mul : ∀ x : ℝ, 0 * x = 0) -- this lemma says that for all real numbers `x`, multiplying `x` by zero on the left yields zero.  

example (x y : ℕ) (h₁ : x = 0) (h₂ : y = 0) :
  x * y = 0 := 
begin
  rw h₁, -- we substitute `0` for `x` in the goal 
  rw h₂, -- we substitute `0` for `y` in the goal 
  exact zero_mul 0, -- we apply lemma `zero_mul` to `0` to prove that `0 * 0 = 0`. 
end 

-- another proof of the same statement
example (x y : ℕ) (h₁ : x = 0) (h₂ : y = 0) :
  x * y = 0 := 
begin
  rw h₂, 
  exact zero_mul y, -- this time we apply lemma `zero_mul` to `y`, to prove that `0 * y = 0`. 
end 

-- yet another proof of the same statement
example (x y : ℕ) (h₁ : x = 0) (h₂ : y = 0) :
  x * y = 0 := 
begin
  rw h₁, 
  rw h₂, 
  exact mul_zero 0, -- `mul_zero` isntead of `zero_mul`. 
end 


/- 
remember the example below from previos lecture? we had the problem of applying `rw` directly to `h₁` (since `x + 0` is not a subexpression of the goal), so we applied the tactic `change`. But we could also use the lemma `add_zero : ∀ (a : ℕ), a + 0 = a` to first repalce `x + 0` by `x` in hypothesis `h₁` to obtain a new `h₁ : x = y`, and then replace `x` by `y` in the goal using `rw h₁`. The new goal is now `y = z`. Finally, we finish the proof by copying `h₂`. 
-/
example (x y z : ℕ)
  (h₁ : x + 0 = y) (h₂ : y = z) : x = z :=
begin
--  rw h, -- fails because rw works up to syntactic equality
  rw add_zero at h₁, -- would also work; note that the proof of `add_zero` is `refl`.
  rw h₁, -- now it works
  exact h₂, 
end



-- maybe seach_library or suggest? 
lemma add_sub_left (x y z : ℕ) : 
x + y - x = y := 
begin
rw add_comm, 
-- seach_library
-- suggest
exact nat.add_sub_cancel y x,
end 

#lint 

example (x y z : ℕ) : 
x + y - x = y := 
begin
rw add_comm, 
refine nat.add_sub_cancel _ _, -- use show_term to get the exact term
end 

/- 
In the following exercises, we will use the following two lemmas:
  ` mul_assoc a b c : a * b * c = a * (b * c) `
  ` mul_comm a b : a * b = b * a `

Hence the command 
  `rw mul_assoc a b c`,
will replace `a * b * c` by `a * (b * c)` in the current goal.

In order to replace backward, we use
  ` rw ← mul_assoc a b c`,
replacing `a * ( b * c )` by `a * b * c` in the current goal.
-/

example (a b c : ℝ) : 
  (a * b) * c = b * (a * c) :=
begin
  rw mul_comm a b,
  rw mul_assoc b a c,
end


example (a b c : ℝ) : a * (b * c) = b * (a * c) :=
begin
  rw ← mul_assoc a b c, 
  nth_rewrite 1 mul_comm, 
  rw mul_assoc, 
end

/-
Now let's return to the preceding example to experiment with what happens if we don't give arguments to `mul_assoc` or `mul_comm`. For instance, you can start the next proof with
  `rw ← mul_assoc`,
Try to figure out what happens.
-/

example (a b c : ℝ) : 
  a * (b * c) = b * (a * c) :=
begin
  rw ← mul_assoc,
  nth_rewrite 1 mul_comm,
  rw mul_assoc,
end





example (a b c : ℝ) : 
  a * (b * c) = b * (a * c) :=
begin
  rw mul_comm, 
  rw mul_assoc,
  nth_rewrite 1 mul_comm,
end   




/- We can also perform _rewriting in an assumption_ of the local context, using for instance
  `rw mul_comm a b at h`,
in order to replace `a * b` by `b * a` in assumption `h`.

The next example will use a third lemma:
  `two_mul a : 2 * a = a + a`
-/

example (a b c d : ℝ) (h₁ : c = d * a + b) (h₂ : b = a * d) : c = 2 * a * d :=
begin
  rw h₂ at h₁,
  rw mul_comm at h₁,
  rw ← two_mul (a * d) at h₁,
  rw ← mul_assoc at h₁,
  exact h₁, 
end
